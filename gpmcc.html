		<p>This is a collection of my various coding projects since 2018. I generally write all code without use of AI, but have started to incorporate it into my work.</p>
		
		<p><a href="games.html">Games</a>: This showcases my most advanced work - playable text-based games, some of which took several full days of coding.</p>
		<p><a href="basic.html">Basic Programming Projects</a>: These were created from September to December of 2024, as part of the Programming Fundamentals course at Mohawk College. 
		I already had a good grip of Python by this point, so solving the problem was quite trivial in most cases. However, the course did introduce me to the use of AI in programming, 
		and placed an emphasis on correct code-writing discipline, as well as identifying errors in code.</p>
		<p><a href="math.html">Math Challenges</a>: Sometimes, I'll come across a math problem during my internet perusal, and see if I can solve it using Python.</p>
		<p>Utility Projects: A bit more of a mish-mash of programming challenges, but these are intended to have a more real-life (albeit niche) applications.</p>
		<p><a href="solvers.html">Game Solvers</a>: Similar to the Math Challenges, but focused on solving game problems (mobile, video game or even board games) using code.</p>
		<p>Trading: I practised day trading for several months and incorporated Python into the data analysis. The scripts here are niche and not easily accessible to the average reader, but I have included them for record purposes.</p>
